# CPI-Japan-Data-Analysis-Project


This project explores long-term Consumer Price Index (CPI) trends in Japan from 1970 to 2022, with a focus on the impact of major economic events such as the Oil Shocks, the Lost Decade, the 2008 Financial Crisis, and COVID-19.  

Using CPI categories such as Gas, Electricity, Food, Housing, Education, and Medical Care, I combined data visualization and rolling volatility analysis to better understand how inflation behaved across different sectors of the economy.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Line plots, box plots, and volatility graphs across categories.
- **Event Markers:** Historical crises aligned with CPI data for context.
- **Rolling Volatility:** Captures periods of stability vs. high uncertainty.
- **Sector-Level Insights:** Highlights differences in price stability between essentials (food, housing, energy) and services (education, healthcare).

## Results at a Glance
- Energy-related categories (Gas, Electricity, Other Fuel & Light) showed high volatility, particularly during Oil Shocks and global crises.
- Housing and rent remained relatively stable with long-term gradual increases.
- Food and its subcategories displayed short-term shocks but reverted faster compared to energy.
- Medical care categories exhibited steady upward pressure, reflecting structural costs rather than shocks.
